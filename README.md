# ATLAS-treatments
Parameter enumeration program for optimizing semiconductor devices (using simulation of optical and electronic properties in the commercial program SILVACO ATLAS) using MATLAB with the following steps:
1. Reading the file of the structure of the semiconductor device of ATLAS (on the example of calculating the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell);
2. Interpretation of ATLAS commands from this file;
3. Generation of new files with the ATLAS structure with changed parameters;
4. Start ATLAS with these structure files under RED HAT linux;
5. On completion of the simulation in ATLAS, read the result files and extract the required resulting data;
6. Display the calculated data in the MATLAB graphical environment and save it in the preferred format.
